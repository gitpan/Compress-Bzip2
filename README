                     Perl-Bzip2 -- Bzip2 bindings for Perl5


What is Bzip2 ?
=============
Bzip2 is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
It offers pretty fast compression and fast decompression.
Bzip2 has very good results, if you want to compress ASCII Documents.

What is Perl ?
==============
Perl is an interpreted programming language optimized for scanning
text and useful for many system management tasks. To find out more,
point your browser to http://www.perl.org/ .


What is Perl-Bzip2 ?
==================
Perl-Bzip2 provides Bzip2 bindings for Perl5. I.e. you can access the
Bzip2 library from your Perl scripts there by compressing ordinary
Perl strings.


Any caveats ?
=============
As I'm no Perl guru I'm not sure if I got everything right - it
works fine for me, though. 

Bug fixes and other feedback are welcome.

Well, the original author (Gawdi Azem) didn't appear to be maintaining this or
responding to email, and it had several bugs especially if you were working with 
larger files. It also did not compile correctly against the current version of 
Bzip. Anyway it's all fixed now. I'm using it in production and have been for
several months - so if you find a bug feel free to email me.
