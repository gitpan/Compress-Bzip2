What is Bzip2 ?
=============
Bzip2 is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
It offers pretty fast compression and fast decompression.
Bzip2 has very good results, if you want to compress ASCII Documents.

What is Perl ?
==============
Perl is an interpreted programming language optimized for scanning
text and useful for many system management tasks. To find out more,
point your browser to http://www.perl.org/ .


What is Perl-Bzip2 ?
==================
Perl-Bzip2 provides Bzip2 bindings for Perl5. I.e. you can access the
Bzip2 library from your Perl scripts there by compressing ordinary
Perl strings.


Any caveats ?
=============
As I'm no Perl guru I'm not sure if I got everything right - it
works fine for me, though.

Bug fixes and other feedback are welcome.

Well, I just wanna tell you, that this was just a test of writing perl.
Therefore I hope, that the two functions I have exported to perl will work.
