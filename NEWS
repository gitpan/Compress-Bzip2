Fixed error with compressing certain strings (buffer was too small); now using
recommended 101% + 600 bytes.

Added error() method to return the last error if other functions return undef
(previously there was no error feedback, just the undef).

Various XS cleanups.

Added progressive compress/decompress interface: compress_init() and
decompress_init(), which return a stream object (see perldoc).

Add true tests using Test framework.

Added BZ2_ prefix to function names so that it works with newer libbz2s
(version > 1.0).

Well, I do not think that I am gonna support this interface to the bzip2
these days. After my studies perhaps, therefore, if you want to update this
package, please send me an email to: azemgi@rupert.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de
