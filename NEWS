Version 1.01
After reading the note below i've picked up the torch and updated this so it
handles much larger buffers and also compiles correctly against Bzip2 1.0.1.
Enjoy! any bugs email me at brian@zoovy.com or brian@digitalco.com

Version 1.0
Well, I do not think that I am gonna support this interface to the bzip2
these days. After my studies perhaps, therefore, if you want to update this
package, please send me an email to: azemgi@rupert.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de
