Revision history for Perl extension Compress::Bzip2.

2.00 Wed Apr 13 16:33:35 2005

This is a complete re-write of Compress::Bzip2.  I left the in-memory
compress routines much as is, compress and decompress.

(re)created by h2xs 1.23 with options
	-b 5.6.0 -n Compress::Bzip2 bzlib.h

I wanted Compress::Zlib compatibility cause I have s/w that uses
Compress::Zlib and I wanted an easy migration path, since bzlib gives
about 20-30% better compression on ascii files than gzip.

This is a 2.x release.  Since there was a change in authorship, I
figured I should bump the major version number.  I could have easily
given this a slightly different name.  Given the minimal functionality
of version 1, that didn't seem like a useful thing to do.  Heck,
version 1 doesn't even work with bzlib 1.x, you have to patch in the
BZ2_ prefixes, so my guess is that Compress::Bzip2 isn't being used
in a lot of places.

2.01 Sat Apr 23 2005
   - cleaned up for 64bit, HPUX PA-RISC 2.0W and itanium
   - fleshed out the Compress::Zlib compatibility, added a
     couple of tests for it.
   - added bzip2, bunzip2 and bzcat, which act like the bzip
     commands.
   - added some compatibility for windows, can't test it out really
   - added the bzlib library underneath
   - changed the test suite so that it does not rely on bzip2
     being installed.
   - added a test to the Makefile.PL to determine whether or
     not the internal Bzlib is necessary.

2.02 Sat Apr 23 2005
   - 2.01 rejected by PAUSE because the META.yml was invalid
   - learned how to do "make dist"

2.03 Sun Apr 24 2005
   - didn't have config.in in the MANIFEST, the tarball was unbuildable.
   - rewrote the INSTALL, README to give help on the config.in options
     for locating your bzip2 installation.

2.04 Mon Apr 25 2005
   - tested different styles of builds.  confirmed some errors in the
     Makefile.PL test for bzip2 that were pointed out by Sisyphus.
   - Sisyphus reported some changes necessary for windows builds.  I
     injected those changes into the code.  one of them, adding
     aTHX_ to the call to PerlIO_binmode seems like a perl version
     thing.
   - added tests for internal_bzlib, copied from bzip2 1.0.2.
