2.01 Wed Apr 20 2005
     - cleaned up for 64bit, HPUX PA-RISC 2.0W and itanium
	 - fleshed out the Compress::Zlib compatibility, added a
	   couple of tests for it.
	 - added bzip2, bunzip2 and bzcat, which act like the bzip
	   commands.
	 - added some compatibility for windows, can't test it out really
	 - added the bzlib library underneath
	 - changed the test suite so that it does not rely on bzip2
	   being installed.
	 - added a test to the Makefile.PL to determine whether or
	   not the internal Bzlib is necessary.
